### ROS Workspace

A quick summary of the folders or 'spaces' taken from [ROS wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/workspaces#Build_Space)

> The **source** (src) space contains the source code of ROS packages.

> The **build** space is where CMake is invoked to build the packages in the source space

> The **development** (devel) space is where built targets are placed prior to being installed.

In general, users work only within the `src` folder
